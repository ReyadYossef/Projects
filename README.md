This Python code implements the "Two Box Game," where two players take turns placing blocks on a 4x4 grid. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

Author Information: Provides the author's name, ID, version, and the date the code was last modified.

Importing Modules: Imports the random module to generate random numbers for player selection.

Function Definitions:

initialize_board(): Initializes the game board with empty cells represented by 0.
print_board(board): Prints the current state of the game board.
is_adjacent(box1, box2): Checks if two boxes are adjacent on the game board.
is_empty(board, box): Checks if a specific box on the game board is empty.
place_block(board, box1, box2, player): Places a block on the game board if the move is valid.
switch_player(player): Switches between players.
is_board_full(board): Checks if the game board is full.
has_adjacent_boxes(board): Checks if there are adjacent empty boxes on the game board.
print_welcome_message(): Prints the welcome message and game instructions.
play_game(): Controls the flow of the game, allowing players to make moves and determines the game's outcome.
Main Execution:

Calls print_welcome_message() to display game instructions.
Enters a loop where players are prompted to start the game or exit.
If the player chooses to start, the game initializes the board, randomly selects the starting player, and enters a loop where players take turns making moves until the game board is full or there are no adjacent empty boxes available.
After the game ends, it prints the winner or declares a draw if the board is full.
This code encapsulates the logic for playing the Two Box Game and provides a structured approach for managing game state and player interactions.
